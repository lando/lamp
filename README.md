# LAMP Lando Plugin

This is the _official_ [Lando](https://lando.dev) plugin for [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29). When installed it...

* Allows users to run a `lamp` stack
* Allows users to configure `php` version from `5.3` all the way to `8.1`
* Allows users to configure `webroot`
* Allows users to configure an `apache` web server
* Allows users to configure database backend to (`mariadb`, `mysql`, or `postgres`)
* Allows users to configure `composer`
* Allows users to configure `xdebug`

Of course, once a user is running their LAMP project with Lando they can take advantage of [all the other awesome development features](https://docs.lando.dev) Lando provides.

## Basic Usage

Add a `lamp` recipe to your Landofile

```yaml
