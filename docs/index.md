# LAMP

The [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) stack is a common infrastructure designed to run PHP applications.

Lando offers a configurable [recipe](https://docs.lando.dev/config/recipes.html) for developing [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) apps.

Note that this recipe is for a generic LAMP stack. Definitely check out Lando's [other recipes](https://docs.lando.dev/config/recipes.html) before you use this as there may be one designed specifically for use with your framework.
